📖 Book-Themed Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website designed as a digital book. Instead of a traditional scrolling layout, the portfolio uses a page-based structure to present information in a clear, structured, and engaging way.

Each section is treated as a page, allowing visitors to navigate through my profile, skills, projects, and experiences as if they are reading a book.

✨ Features

Book-style page navigation with smooth transitions

Dark, minimal, and premium visual theme

Structured sections for profile, skills, projects, and contact

Dedicated Contents page for easy navigation

Thank You page with return-to-home interaction

Fully responsive across devices

🧭 Navigation Structure

Home: Book cover and introduction

Contents: Central navigation hub

Inner Pages: Skills, projects, experience, and other sections

Thank You: Closing page with option to return to Home

Each page follows consistent layout and interaction patterns to maintain the book-reading experience.
